<h3>About</h3>

Application focused on searching the meaning of words through web scraping, besides having more functions such as Dictation, Spelling and Syllables.<br>
I created this application as a way to test the knowledge that I have started to acquire so I decided to make this dictionary with some basic functions like spelling but from there more ideas came up, like implementing a method that would tell me the meanings of the words that I didn't understand, or a way in which I didn't have to write the word and just by telling the computer I could write it. When I created this application I was just starting to learn Python (it is the language I used for this application) so I may have a lot of bad practices in the code that I am correcting for future versions. During the creation of this application I learned how to make user interfaces, I dabbled a bit in web scraping and besides investigating a method with which I can change text to sound and play it also at the end I used object oriented programming to facilitate the creation of the interface.
