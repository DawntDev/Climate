<h3>About</h3>

Web extension for visualization of weather and other climate components.<br>
I created this extension because I found the idea in a web page called <a href="https://devchallenges.io/">devChallenges</a>. It proposed the creation of a web page where you could get information about the weather through an API and thus be able to use the data returned to us to display them on the page. I decided that instead of a web page it would be better to encapsulate everything in an extension. When creating the extension I encountered a problem which was the CORS protocol that prevented me from using the API. In the end I managed to solve it by setting up a personal CORS proxy to act as an intermediary between the extension and the API. I found this project very entertaining as I was able to put into practice my knowledge about JS and the use of APIs.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

</div>

The entire project was created with HTLM, CSS and JavaScript in addition to the use of certain repositories such as axios and cors-anywhere for certain vital aspects of the project.

- Functioning
  - You get information about the weather through a 32-bit reference identifier (Woeid) that is obtained through a request. It takes as data your current Latitude and Longitude and when you receive all this information it is stored in local storage so that you don't have to ask for the information every time you close or open the extension. It also has a function that detects when the day has changed and automatically updates the weather information.
- Use of [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
  - Axios is a JavaScript library that can be executed in the browser and allows us to make HTTP client operations easy, so we can configure and make requests to a server and receive easy-to-process responses.
- Use of [Cors-Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)
  - CORS Anywhere is a NodeJS proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request.Thanks to it we were able to communicate with the API without any problem. By creating a personal proxy this [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43881141) comes from user sideshowbarker on StackOverflow.
- What I learned
  - During the development of this project I learned a lot about the use of APIs and web requests I also put into practice the use of asynchronous functions and other things that I had not used before in JavaScript.

## Features

Inside the extension we will be able to find:
- A button to get the information of your current location.
<!-- - A button to get the information of a specific location. -->
The information displayed on the screen will be:
- Temperature
- Climate
- Current date
- Current location
- Weekly forecast
  - Forecast date
  - Forecast temperature max
  - Forecast temperature min
- Todayâ€™s Hightlights
  - Wind status
  - Humidity
  - Visibility 
  - Air pressure

This application/site was created as a submission to a [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
